## Project source
I would like to sincerely thank the author of the site from which I drew inspiration :
[instructables.com/Automated-Chessboard](https://www.instructables.com/Automated-Chessboard/)

## Introduction
I am pleased to present my exciting project: Auto-Mate, an automated chess game designed to give a new dimension to this game. By enabling remote movement of pieces, I create the possibility of bringing chess online or against a robot on a chessboard. To achieve this, I have developed a case that handles the movement of the pieces. Auto-Mate is equipped with a screen, allowing for the automatic movement of pieces. It is also possible to move them manually using sensors located beneath the board. I made this project because I enjoy playing chess. It has allowed me to learn many new things in electronics and programming. Auto-mate is still in developpement (mostly the code). I invite you to see my work in the [TFE](TFE) folder, there is a more detailed documentation of my project. I also want to add that I am still a young student. My work and my code are far from perfect and contain many errors. My goal, above all, is to present my work and maybe inspire some people.

## The block diagram

![Schema bloc](https://github.com/DawidSac24/AutoMate/assets/171250080/c1ea0b3d-b250-44f0-b621-0e71598915d2)

#### The Microcontroller
It is the brain of the setup, allowing control of each component (motors, motor drivers, electromagnet, multiplexers, and touchscreen) and reading the necessary data (limit switches, buttons, magnetic sensors, and touchscreen).
#### The Touchscreen
It provides the ability to navigate through menus to change the AI difficulty, display the timer, modify game settings, or select the game mode. It communicates with the UART, an asynchronous serial bus.
#### Motor Drivers A and B
They control the coils of the stepper motors and provide the necessary current to operate them.
#### Motors A and B
They are connected to a belt system, moving the electromagnet on the x and y axes.
#### The Electromagnet
It is placed underneath the board and is used to move the magnetized pieces on the board.
#### The Multiplexer
It successively reads the signals from the 8 sensors and sends the data to the microprocessor.
#### Magnetic Sensors
They determine the presence of the chess pieces.
#### x and y Limit Switches
They locate the position of the electromagnet by resetting at the start of the game. They allow for calibration of its position and help avoid potential misalignments during movement.

## Characteristics
### General :
- Color graphical resistive touchscreen, 320Ã—240 pixels
- 2 arcade buttons
- 32 magnetized pieces
- Operating modes: 1/2 players
- Automatic piece movement
- Automatic piece detection
- Area for eliminated pieces
### Electronics :
- Power supply: 12V, 2A
### Mechanics :

- 6 plywood faces
- Weight: 4 kg

## Used libraries
I planned to use a [Nextion library](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial/) for the code of my touchscreen, but I accidentally connected my screen to the wrong pins of my microcontroller and had to use my touchscreen manually with the [SoftwareSerial library](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/built-in-libraries/software-serial/).

## My code
I wanted to add an algorithm that would be used for an enemy robot. Unfortunately, I did not finish verifying the allowed moves for the pawns, which is required for the algorithm. If you would like to see my algorithm development then, you would have to wait for the next updates. To compensate, here is what I plan to do for the enemy robot algorithm:

It is called the Min-Max algorithm, and I will use Alpha-Beta pruning, which evaluates unnecessary calculations and ignores unwanted possibilities. I invite you to search for some documentation about Min-Max and Alpha-Beta that is really interesting. Here is a video that explains the algorithm very well:
